# Library

## Introduction
Welcome to my Library project!  

This is an interactive library which allows users to add their own books and mark each of them as "finished" when they are done reading them.  
Users are also able to delete any placeholder books or any book they have added.

## Features
* __Navigation Bar__: Easy access to different sections of the website (non-functional).
* __Header__:
    * __Search Bar (non-functional)__.
    * __Mini user icon with a notification indicator__.
* __Discovery Section__:
    * A non-functional carousel showcasing book covers, including the book's name, author and "Discover Now" buttons. 
* __Book of the Week Section__:
    * Highlights the Book of the Week along with the title, author, star rating and description.
* __My Books__:
    * Displays 3 placeholder books.
    * Each book can be marked as read or removed using interactive buttons on the book cards.
    * Includes an interactive "Add Book" button which allows users to add their own books to the library.
    * Users can input the book title, author, number of pages, and upload or drag-and-drop their own book cover. 
    * Added Books can also be marked as read before they are added to the library.

## Limitations (Current Version)
